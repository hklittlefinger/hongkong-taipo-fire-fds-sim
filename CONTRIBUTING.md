# Contributing to Wang Fuk Court Fire Documentation

This project documents the Wang Fuk Court fire tragedy (November 26, 2025) to preserve evidence, enable independent analysis, and support fire safety improvements. We welcome contributions from anyone with relevant information.

## Why This Matters

159 lives were lost. Understanding what happened—through evidence preservation, technical analysis, and fire dynamics simulation—can help prevent future tragedies and support accountability.

## What We Need

- **First-hand accounts**: Witness statements, survivor accounts (can be anonymized)
- **Photos/Videos**: Incident footage, building conditions, scaffolding details
- **Official documents**: Government statements, investigation reports, regulations
- **Building records**: Construction documents, renovation permits, inspection reports

### Technical Analysis
- Fire spread timeline reconstruction
- Building systems analysis
- Regulatory compliance review
- Scaffolding material testing results

### Simulation
- FDS model improvements
- Validation against observed fire behavior
- Alternative scenario modeling
